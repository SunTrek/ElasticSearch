===============
- Presence of deleted docs might impact the read and writes operation on ES

Deleting documents only flags these as deleted, so they would not be searched. To reclaim disk space, you have to optimize the index:

curl -XPOST 'http://localhost:9200/_optimize?only_expunge_deletes=true'

POST /_forcemerge?only_expunge_deletes=true
